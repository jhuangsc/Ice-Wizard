UI
- GUI class to handle displaying
- UI class (containing GUI) to handle responses to input
- UIElement object
- Target portrait: show the name and stats of the last thing you hit
- Should also handle user input based on Events sent from main
- Main menu! Should be able to change most of the settings from there too
  - Needs a graphic that is 800x600 but looks good at higher res (no stretching)
- Tutorial!
- Better level screen! Maybe even scorekeeping?
- Detailed and dynamic tooltips

Gameplay
- make Frostfire Golem more challenging
- give Mad Mage some new attacks
- figure out why Flame Sprites aggro from so far
- Fire Elemental: has Flame Wave attack
- Incinerator: Vortex affix a la D3
- collision for mobs so they don't stack up (Gary's module?)
- projectiles travel a limited distance
- Commands! particularly Move To, Patrol, etc
- passive Effects, maybe even a trait tree
- make knockback cancel out base movement for its duration

Graphics
- onHit VFX
- image-based VFX, maybe even with sprites or GIFs and rotation
- onDeath VFX
- redo the icons
- redo the boss sprites (except the mages)

Efficiency
- make Effect constructor to copy from another effect instead of reading from file every time
  - add effects arraylist to GameData
  - merge GameAbilities to GameData
- split IWObjects into IWObject > IWMover (> IWBattler, IWProjectile), IWDoodad (> IWItem)
- move a lot of stuff away from main
  - move object related stuff to World
  - move garbage collection to World
  - move user input handling to UI
  - clean up level transitions
